# Simple Wordle (Tkinter)

This is a work in progress remake of the game Wordle.  
Right now it has a player vs player mode where one person enters a secret word and the other tries to guess it.  
The game uses Tkinter for the window and NLTK for word checking.

## Status

This project is not finished yet.  
More features will be added later, such as a player vs CPU mode.
